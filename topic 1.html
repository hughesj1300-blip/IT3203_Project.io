      <li>Definition of Web Browsers</li>
        <p>A web browser is an application that allows the user to make a connection to the open internet. 
            The function of this system is to process a universal resource identifier (URL), acquire the 
            corresponding resource, and deliver it to the user in an interpretable format.  </p>

      <li>Web Browser History</li>
        <p>The first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. 
            It was later renamed Nexus to avoid confusion with the World Wide Web itself. 
            The first graphical web browser, Mosaic, was released in 1993 and helped popularize the web.</p>
        <p>Since then, web browsers have evolved significantly, with improvements in speed, security, and user experience. 
            Today, there are many web browsers available, each with its own features and capabilities.</p>
              <li>Popular Web Browsers</li>

      <li>Web Browsers of the future</li>

            and better integration with other devices and services.</p>

            with the vast resources of the internet.</p>

    <p>As we look at the past and the future of web browsers, it is clear that they have come a long way and will continue to evolve.</p>
    <p>Understanding the history and current state of web browsers is important for anyone interested in web development or internet technology.</p>
