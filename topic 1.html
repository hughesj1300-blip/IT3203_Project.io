        <li>Definition of Web Browsers</li>
          <p>A web browser is an application that allows the user to make a connection to the open internet. 
              The function of this system is to process a universal resource identifier (URL), acquire the 
              corresponding resource, and deliver it to the user in an interpretable format.  </p>
              <br>
        <li>Web Browser History</li>
          <p>The first web browser, called WorldWideWeb, was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. 
              It was later renamed Nexus to avoid confusion with the World Wide Web itself. 
              The first graphical web browser, Mosaic, was released in 1993 and helped popularize the web.</p>
          <p>Since then, web browsers have evolved significantly, with improvements in speed, security, and user experience. 
              Today, there are many web browsers available, each with its own features and capabilities.</p>
